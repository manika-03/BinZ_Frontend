**Implementation Evidence**
- Service Hub URL: `http://localhost:5503/index.html#service`
- E-waste tracker page URL: `http://localhost:5503/index.html#ewaste-tracker`
- Viewport/state: desktop in-app browser, Service Hub visible with four cards and aligned CTAs. The `Open tracker` CTA navigates to a separate e-waste tracker page that uses a page hero/status layout instead of the earlier certificate-like framed panel.
- Density normalization: none; comparison was evaluated at product-flow level because the request was to align the existing service controls and route the tracker to a new page.
- Safety guidance page URL: `http://localhost:5503/#learn`

**Required Fidelity Surfaces**
- Fonts and typography: Uses the existing BinZ Inter/Instrument Serif stack. The new tracker uses strong headline hierarchy, compact status labels, and no text overlap in the captured desktop state.
- Tracker typography update: The tracker hero heading now follows the same treatment as the learn-page heading reference: Inter, `500` weight, `clamp(38px, 4.7vw, 66px)`, `1` line-height, and `-4px` desktop letter spacing. The lead remains `17px`, and the journey heading remains smaller at `clamp(26px, 2.9vw, 36px)`.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: The new tracker follows the site page rhythm from the donate/learn examples: open hero area, right-side device status card, full-width journey section, processing summary, and report CTA.
- Colors and visual tokens: Uses the site tokens for pine, moss, mint, cream, teal and muted text. FAQ drawer opacity is increased to `rgba(251, 250, 242, 0.96)`, and the ticket drawer uses `rgba(251, 250, 242, 0.98)`.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: Existing BinZ logo asset remains only in the header; the duplicate tracker-body logo was removed. The laptop is represented with the existing Lucide visual language to keep the integration frontend-only and consistent with the current app.
- Copy/content: The new copy mirrors the reference's e-waste tracking intent and keeps the demo status data local to the frontend.

**Interactions Tested**
- `Track your E-waste` card is visible in the Service Hub.
- Service navbar dropdown check: clicking `SERVICE` opens a dropdown with `E-waste ticket`, `Track e-waste`, and `Help and FAQ`; `Service hub` has been removed.
- Dropdown alignment check: both `IMPACT` and `SERVICE` dropdown rows now use flex alignment with a fixed-width icon column, an 8px gap, and cleaned label text so icons line up with the text.
- Dropdown overlap check: opening `IMPACT` sets the Impact dropdown opacity to `1` and Service dropdown opacity to `0`; opening `SERVICE` sets the Impact dropdown opacity to `0` and Service dropdown opacity to `1`.
- Hover dropdown check: hovering `IMPACT` opens only the Impact dropdown; hovering `SERVICE` opens only the Service dropdown and closes Impact.
- Service dropdown action check: clicking `E-waste ticket` opens `#ticketPanel` with the `Raise a ticket` form.
- Service dropdown action check: clicking `Help and FAQ` opens `#chatDrawer` with the `How can BinZ help?` options.
- Standalone page support check: the shared header now receives the same drawer-opening callbacks on standalone routes as it does on the main page.
- Ticket drawer opacity check: opening `Open ticket` renders `#ticketPanel.open` with background `rgba(251, 250, 242, 0.98)`, reducing background text visibility from the page underneath.
- Button top positions in the Service Hub were aligned at the same y-coordinate in the browser: `Open ticket`, `Open account`, `Open FAQs`, and `Open tracker`.
- The `Open tracker` CTA navigates to `http://localhost:5503/index.html#ewaste-tracker`.
- The new page shows `Your e-waste is on its way to a cleaner tomorrow.`
- Navbar routing from tracker page: `SCRAP`, `EARN COINS`, and `SERVICE` were clicked from `#ewaste-tracker`; each rendered the main page and scrolled directly to `#scrap`, `#earn`, and `#service`.
- Section scroll check: verified target section tops at `99px` below the viewport top, leaving room for the sticky header.
- Recycling report CTA check: exactly one `Download Recycling Report` button is present, old `View Full Recycling Report` text is absent, helper sentence is absent, and `.report-panel` is not rendered.
- Backend hook check: the download button exposes `data-report-download` for future PDF wiring.
- Demo video placement check: `.device-status-card .tracker-video` count is `0`; `.device-status-card .device-visual svg` exists; `.binz-demo-section .tracker-video` exists at the top of the tracker page.
- Demo-first order check: `.ewaste-tracker` child order is `binz-demo-section`, `tracker-page-hero`, `tracker-journey`, `processing-summary`, `report-action`.
- Demo size check: the top `How BinZ works` section now renders larger, with the video frame measured at `640 x 360`, section height `473px`, heading `42px`, and body text `18px` in the verified browser viewport.
- Autoplay video check: `.tracker-video` exists in the new `How BinZ works` section, uses `/assets/binz-promotional-video.mp4`, and is configured with `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`, `playsInline`, and `preload="auto"`.
- Video asset check: `http://localhost:5503/assets/binz-promotional-video.mp4` responds with `200`, `content-type: video/mp4`, and `content-length: 17501347`.
- Duplicate logo check: `.ewaste-tracker img` count is `0`; header logo count remains `1`.
- Page-shell check: `.ewaste-tracker` background is transparent, border width is `0px`, and box shadow is `none`.
- Typography check: Browser-computed tracker hero heading is `60.16px`, Inter, `500`, `-4px` letter spacing and `60.16px` line-height on the verified desktop viewport.
- Navigation position check: Clicking `Open tracker` from the Service Hub lands on `http://localhost:5503/index.html#ewaste-tracker` with `window.scrollY` equal to `0`; the tracker heading is visible near the top.
- The original CO2 tracker heading is not present on the standalone e-waste tracker page.
- Safety guidance content check: the Learn page includes a new `Safety guidance` section with pictorial cards for battery heat/leakage, CRT/display risk, device traceability loss and unsafe dismantling.
- BinZ safety promise check: the section connects hazards to the existing product flow: doorstep pickup, e-waste tickets, facility tracking, FAQ support, responsible recycling updates and report-ready proof.
- Safety guidance responsive check: desktop and mobile headless Chrome captures were reviewed; the section keeps the existing Learn page aesthetic and stacks into one column on narrow screens.
- Safety guidance placement check: the section now appears below the Refurbish/Rebuild/Reuse cards and the green `Small choices add up` next-step strip.
- Safety guidance fill check: the formerly empty top-right area now contains a BinZ safety-prep panel, and the hazard grid now includes six pictorial points so the cards do not read as sparse.
- Safety guidance pictorial redesign check: the section now uses a centered reference-style intro, handwritten side notes, a numbered vertical safety story, alternating image/component panels, status chips, material recovery cards, and BinZ safety proof notes.
- Safety guidance content coverage check: the infographic includes protected pickup, item scanning, battery heat/leakage, CRT/display risk, short-circuit risk, facility checkpoints, PPE sorting, material recovery and report-ready proof.
- Current iteration verification note: production build passed; the Learn page was opened in the in-app browser and the Safety Guidance section rendered with seven steps and two loaded image assets.
- Browser console errors checked: none.

**Follow-up Polish**
- P3: Replace the current reusable BinZ recycling photos with custom e-waste-specific illustrations later if the project gets a dedicated illustration set.

**Comparison History**
- Initial implementation passed the requested build gate after interaction checks; no P0/P1/P2 fixes were required.
